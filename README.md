# copyofchantcompiler
Welcome to the landing page of my copy of our team's compiler.  Basically in spring quarter of 2018, Professor Ben Hardekopf returned from 1.5 years at Google and changed the compilers course to be 100% group project.  We were given only a textbook, an abstract syntax tree, and advice on how to do code reviews.  We had a team of 7, split into me and 2 others working on the compiler backend, and 4 others working on the frontend.  We were given five versions of the compiler to implement; our backend team implemented them and on top of that, implemented control flow graphs and and static single assignment.  Our code is viewable in the backend folder here.  Please do not share with anyone at UCSB as I am a strong believer of academic integrity.  My contributions are primarily to the visit and conditional logic in the lowerer, the IR, and the SSA (reverse-engineering all those vaguely described dominator functions in the textbook).
