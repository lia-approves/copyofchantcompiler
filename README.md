In spring quarter of 2018, Professor Ben Hardekopf (UCSB CS) returned from 1.5 years at Google and changed the compilers course to be 100% group project. We were given only a textbook, an abstract syntax tree, and advice on how to do code reviews. We had a team of 7, split into me and 2 others working on the compiler backend, and 4 others working on the frontend. We were given five versions of the compiler to implement within 11 weeks.  698 commits, 47 branches, and all frontend and backend tests passing later, we completed the compiler.  Our backend team implemented all assigned compiler features and on top of that, implemented control flow graphs and and static single assignment.
